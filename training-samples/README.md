## DevOps Training Setup - Samples

This folder contains a few selected, and translated assignements from [Brent Fisher's repo for his _Docker Mastery_ Udemy course](https://github.com/bretfisher/udemy-docker-mastery). They are intended for covering different topics, ranging from Docker's basic concepts to Swarm mode orchrestration.

The intended order for consuming them is the following:

1. ``multiple-comtainers-sample``
2. ``volumes-sample``
3. ``dockerfile-sample``
4. ``compose-sample``
5. ``compose-sample-custom``
6. ``swarm-sample``

Each folder includes its own README file with the facilitator's guidelines, or inline guidance comments inside the files within them.
